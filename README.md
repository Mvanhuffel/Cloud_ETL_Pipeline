# CloudETL_TrafficData

## Project Overview

Contains an ETL pipeline developed to handle web traffic analytics data. Designed to extract data from google sheets, transform it according to the required schema, and load it into a postgreSQL database hosted on ElephantSQL (cloud based database service). This pipeline automates the process of data handling in order to seamlessly analyze traffic data for insightful decision making.

## Features
- **Data Extraction**: Fetches data from Google Sheets, utilizing the Google Sheets API.
- **Data Transformation**: Converts and prepares the data for database insertion, ensuring compatibility with the PostgreSQL schema.
- **Data Loading**: Inserts the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database, managing data integrity and consistency.

## Tools/Languages
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for scripting the ETL process.
- **Pandas**: A Python library for data manipulation and analysis, utilized for transforming the data.
- **SQLAlchemy**: A Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library used for database interactions.
- **PostgreSQL**: An open-source object-relational database system, chosen for its robustness and scalability.
- **ElephantSQL**: A cloud-hosted PostgreSQL service that provides the database backend.
- **Google Sheets API**: Used for extracting data from Google Sheets.
- **GitHub**: For version control and sharing the project publicly.
