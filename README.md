# Cloud ETL Traffic Data Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project contains an ETL pipeline developed to migrate web traffic analytics data from wix to a PostgreSQL database. The pipeline is designed to extract data from google sheets, transform it according to the required schema, and load it into a postgreSQL database hosted on ElephantSQL (cloud based database service). It automates the process of data handling in order to seamlessly analyze traffic data for insightful decision making.

## Features
- **Data Extraction**: Fetches data from Google Sheets, utilizing the Google Sheets API.
- **Data Transformation**: Converts and prepares the data for database insertion, ensuring compatibility with the PostgreSQL schema.
- **Data Loading**: Inserts the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database, managing data integrity and consistency.

## Tools/Languages
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for scripting the ETL process.
- **Pandas**: A Python library for data manipulation and analysis, utilized for transforming the data.
- **SQLAlchemy**: A Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library used for database interactions.
- **PostgreSQL**: An open-source object-relational database system, chosen for its robustness and scalability.
- **ElephantSQL**: A cloud-hosted PostgreSQL service that provides the database backend.
- **Google Sheets API**: Used for extracting data from Google Sheets.
- **GitHub**: For version control and sharing the project publicly.
